            <p>My name is Javier Cabezas and I am a software developer currently living in Santiago, Chile.</p>
            <p>I started developing in PHP and stayed on that language for a long while (mainly using 
            <a href="https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2"> the Yii2 framework </a> but I started learning Python/Django and VueJS and fell in love with these techonologies. I expect to start using Python as my main language in the short term.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interests are Math, physics, video games, algorithms, software, tecnology and everything nerdy. I
                really LOVE what I do, geek stuff makes me inmensely happy :)
            </p>
